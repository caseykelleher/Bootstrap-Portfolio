                        I was born in Plainview, NY in the year 1978. Coming from a New York family I was born and raised a die hard Yankee fan. My father hung a poster over my bed of Yankee legends and I was to call out their names by jersey number before bed everynight.
                        Shortly after I turned five years old the family moved all the way to South Florida where we were raised on the west coast in a town called Cape Coral. My sister was always one higher grade school than me so when she finished high school and I middle 
                        school our parents moved us to the east coast of Florida to Boca Raton.

                        Here is where I graduated high school and attened my first college courses.While struggling through pre-requisites for pharmacy school I had the opportunity to open and run my own retail pharmacy. I opened my pharmacy in the year 2009 in the city of 
                        Boynton Beach. I am still currently the sole owner and operator of Neighborhood Pharmacy in 2019. I have currently started a Bootcamp program in the fine institution of UCF. My goal is to join the workforce working in the web development community 
                        as well being an enhancer in my own industry.
